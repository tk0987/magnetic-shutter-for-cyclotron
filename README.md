As for purpose of stopping high energy ion beam, Halbach cylinder of coils is suggested. It has high efficiency and is small enough.
Such coils can be made with PCB only. 


with 10 amps it was able to stop 60 MeV protons, according to scpecific ion guides and magnets geometry. 160 militeslas inside the cyllinder - within several % uniformity.

This particular solution can work for any cyclotron, but after adjustments. kinda obvious

as for particle path integration, i've provided momentum energy conservation rule (code for this part was merely mine)

In the main file:
18 coils in two Halbach cylinders (6 coils: inside ring, 12 - outside). 

and nice, nice fields
